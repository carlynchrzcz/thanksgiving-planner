## Code Architecture

### App.js

The html beguns App.js, which defines the total list of 
items and their fields (name - the item name, difficulty - 
the difficulty to prepare the item, category - the category of 
food of the item, cooktime - the time it takes to cook, and 
image - an image of the item). App.js displays the title
of the page.
